                                         Project: Tree Algorithms Collection[Tree Library]


In this project I have been implemented different Tree Data Structures which are taking the Characters as their input from the the particular input file through the command Line Argument.I have inplemented "Binary Search Tree", "Adelson Velski Landis Tree"and The "B-Tree".
  
      * Project is about the Implementation of the Different Tree Data Structures by taking the input from some file that consists of characters.It is suggested that project must be complied with the GNU Complier.
     *When ever you are running the program please give the file at the time of running that is use command line argument
      Input of the project is the File.
      Ouput that you get is selecting choice among  the Binary Search Tree,Adelson Velski Landis Tree , B-Tree and Termination of the Program
            Under  Binary Serch Tree   we have following have being implemented
                -height of the Binary Search Tree
                - Depth of the Binary Search Tree
                 - Total number of nodes in the Binary Search Tree
                 - Total Number of the Leaf Nodes in the Binary Search Tree
                 - Pre order Traversal of the Binary Search Tree
                 - Post Order Traversal of the Binary Search Tree
                 - In order Traversal of the Binary Search Tree
                 - Smallest node in the Binary Search Tree
                 - Largest Node in the Binary Search Tree
                 - Deletion of any Node in the Binary Search Tree
                 - Termination
        Under Adelosn Velski Tree we have following Features
             -Height og the AVL tree
             - Total Number of nodes in the AVL tree
             - Preorder of the AVL tree
             - post order traversal of the AVL tree
              - in order traversal of the AVL tree
             - deleting the element in the AVL tree
             - finding the Balance factor
             - Termination
       Under B tree we have following Features
         - Traversal of the B tree
         - Deleting the element in the B tree
         - Height of the B tree
          - Termination       
     
     It is Recommended to use GNU compliling the Program . It is suggested to use gcc  to run the program rather than the makefile
     since makefileis giving me some trouble.
     Do not forget to use command line argument at the time of execution
